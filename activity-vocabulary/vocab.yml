    The Object type serves as the base type for most of the other kinds of objects defined in the Activity Vocabulary,
    including other Core types such as [Activity], [IntransitiveActivity], [Collection] and [OrderedCollection].

    A Link is an indirect, qualified reference to a resource identified by a URL.
    The fundamental model for links is established by [RFC5988](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5988).
    Many of the properties defined by the Activity Vocabulary allow values that are either instances of [ObjectSubtypes] or [LinkSubtypes].
    When a [Link] is used,
    it establishes a [qualified relation](https://patterns.dataincubator.org/book/qualified-relation.html)
    connecting the subject (the containing object) to the resource identified by the [Link::href].
    Properties of the [Link] are properties of the reference as opposed to properties of the resource.

    is currently happening, or has already happened.
    The [Activity] type itself serves as an abstract base type for all types of activities.
    It is important to note that the [Activity] type itself does not carry any specific semantics about the kind of action being taken.
  properties:
    actor: !Simple

      doc: |
        Describes the indirect object, or target, of the activity.
        The precise meaning of the target is largely dependent on the type of action being described but will often be the object of the English preposition "to".
        For instance, in the activity `John added a movie to his wishlist`, the target of the activity is John's wishlist.
        An activity can have more than one target.

        if a particular action results in the creation of a new resource,
        the result property can be used to describe that new resource.

    origin: !Simple
      type: Or<Remotable<ObjectSubtypes>, LinkSubtypes>
      uri: https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#origin
      doc: |
        Describes an indirect object of the activity from which the activity is directed.
        The precise meaning of the origin is the object of the English preposition "from". For instance,
